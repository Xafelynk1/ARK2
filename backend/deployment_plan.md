# Deployment Plan for Railway

## 1. Prepare the Application for Deployment
- Ensure all code is committed to version control (e.g., Git).
- Verify that the application runs correctly locally without errors.

## 2. Create a Railway Project
- Go to the Railway website and create a new project.
- Connect your GitHub repository or upload project files directly.

## 3. Configure Environment Variables
- In the Railway project settings, add the following environment variables:
  - EMAIL_USER
  - EMAIL_PASS
  - ADMIN_USERNAME
  - ADMIN_PASSWORD
  - JWT_SECRET
  - JWT_REFRESH_SECRET
  - PAYSTACK_PUBLIC_KEY
  - PAYSTACK_SECRET_KEY

## 4. Set Up the Database
- If switching to a more robust database (e.g., MongoDB), set it up through Railway or connect to an external service.
- Update application code to connect to the new database if applicable.

## 5. Deploy the Application
- Trigger the deployment process in Railway.
- Monitor deployment logs for errors or issues.

## 6. Test the Deployed Application
- After deployment, test the application in the Railway environment to ensure all functionalities work as expected.
